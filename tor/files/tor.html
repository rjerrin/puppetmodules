</div>
<h2 id="_description">DESCRIPTION</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p><em>tor</em> is a connection-oriented anonymizing communication
service. Users choose a source-routed path through a set of nodes, and
negotiate a "virtual circuit" through the network, in which each node
knows its predecessor and successor, but no others. Traffic flowing down
the circuit is unwrapped by a symmetric key at each node, which reveals
the downstream node.<br /></p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Basically <em>tor</em> provides a distributed network of servers ("onion routers").
Users bounce their TCP streams&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;web traffic, ftp, ssh, etc&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;around the
routers, and recipients, observers, and even the routers themselves have
difficulty tracking the source of the stream.</p></div>

<dt class="hdlist1">
<strong>BandwidthRate</strong> <em>N</em> <strong>bytes</strong>|<strong>KB</strong>|<strong>MB</strong>|<strong>GB</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    A token bucket limits the average incoming bandwidth usage on this node to
    the specified number of bytes per second, and the average outgoing
    bandwidth usage to that same value.  If you want to run a relay in the
    public network, this needs to be <em>at the very least</em> 20 KB (that is,
    20480 bytes). (Default: 5 MB)
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
<strong>BandwidthBurst</strong> <em>N</em> <strong>bytes</strong>|<strong>KB</strong>|<strong>MB</strong>|<strong>GB</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Limit the maximum token bucket size (also known as the burst) to the given
    number of bytes in each direction. (Default: 10 MB)
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
<strong>MaxAdvertisedBandwidth</strong> <em>N</em> <strong>bytes</strong>|<strong>KB</strong>|<strong>MB</strong>|<strong>GB</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    If set, we will not advertise more than this amount of bandwidth for our
    BandwidthRate. Server operators who want to reduce the number of clients
    who ask to build circuits through them (since this is proportional to
    advertised bandwidth rate) can thus reduce the CPU demands on their server
    without impacting network performance.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
<strong>RelayBandwidthRate</strong> <em>N</em> <strong>bytes</strong>|<strong>KB</strong>|<strong>MB</strong>|<strong>GB</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    If not 0, a separate token bucket limits the average incoming bandwidth
    usage for _relayed traffic_ on this node to the specified number of bytes
    per second, and the average outgoing bandwidth usage to that same value.
    Relayed traffic currently is calculated to include answers to directory
    requests, but that may change in future versions. (Default: 0)
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
<strong>RelayBandwidthBurst</strong> <em>N</em> <strong>bytes</strong>|<strong>KB</strong>|<strong>MB</strong>|<strong>GB</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    If not 0, limit the maximum token bucket size (also known as the burst) for
    _relayed traffic_ to the given number of bytes in each direction.
    (Default: 0)
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
<strong>PerConnBWRate</strong> <em>N</em> <strong>bytes</strong>|<strong>KB</strong>|<strong>MB</strong>|<strong>GB</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    If set, do separate rate limiting for each connection from a non-relay.
    You should never need to change this value, since a network-wide value is
    published in the consensus and your relay will use that value. (Default: 0)
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
<strong>PerConnBWBurst</strong> <em>N</em> <strong>bytes</strong>|<strong>KB</strong>|<strong>MB</strong>|<strong>GB</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    If set, do separate rate limiting for each connection from a non-relay.
    You should never need to change this value, since a network-wide value is
    published in the consensus and your relay will use that value. (Default: 0)
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
<strong>ConnLimit</strong> <em>NUM</em>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    The minimum number of file descriptors that must be available to the Tor
    process before it will start. Tor will ask the OS for as many file
    descriptors as the OS will allow (you can find this by "ulimit -H -n").
    If this number is less than ConnLimit, then Tor will refuse to start.<br />
<br />
    You probably don&#8217;t need to adjust this. It has no effect on Windows
    since that platform lacks getrlimit(). (Default: 1000)
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
<strong>ConstrainedSockets</strong> <strong>0</strong>|<strong>1</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    If set, Tor will tell the kernel to attempt to shrink the buffers for all
    sockets to the size specified in <strong>ConstrainedSockSize</strong>. This is useful for
    virtual servers and other environments where system level TCP buffers may
    be limited. If you&#8217;re on a virtual server, and you encounter the "Error
    creating network socket: No buffer space available" message, you are
    likely experiencing this problem.<br />
<br />
    The preferred solution is to have the admin increase the buffer pool for
    the host itself via /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_mem or equivalent facility;
    this configuration option is a second-resort.<br />
<br />
    The DirPort option should also not be used if TCP buffers are scarce. The
    cached directory requests consume additional sockets which exacerbates
    the problem.<br />
<br />
    You should <strong>not</strong> enable this feature unless you encounter the "no buffer
    space available" issue. Reducing the TCP buffers affects window size for
    the TCP stream and will reduce throughput in proportion to round trip
    time on long paths. (Default: 0.)
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
<strong>ConstrainedSockSize</strong> <em>N</em> <strong>bytes</strong>|<strong>KB</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    When <strong>ConstrainedSockets</strong> is enabled the receive and transmit buffers for
    all sockets will be set to this limit. Must be a value between 2048 and
    262144, in 1024 byte increments. Default of 8192 is recommended.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
<strong>ControlPort</strong> <em>PORT</em>|<strong>auto</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    If set, Tor will accept connections on this port and allow those
    connections to control the Tor process using the Tor Control Protocol
    (described in control-spec.txt). Note: unless you also specify one or
    more of <strong>HashedControlPassword</strong> or <strong>CookieAuthentication</strong>,
    setting this option will cause Tor to allow any process on the local
    host to control it. (Setting both authentication methods means either
    method is sufficient to authenticate to Tor.) This
    option is required for many Tor controllers; most use the value of 9051.
    Set it to "auto" to have Tor pick a port for you. (Default: 0).
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
<strong>ControlListenAddress</strong> <em>IP</em>[:<em>PORT</em>]
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Bind the controller listener to this address. If you specify a port, bind
    to this port rather than the one specified in ControlPort. We strongly
    recommend that you leave this alone unless you know what you&#8217;re doing,
    since giving attackers access to your control listener is really
    dangerous. (Default: 127.0.0.1) This directive can be specified multiple
    times to bind to multiple addresses/ports.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
<strong>ControlSocket</strong> <em>Path</em>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Like ControlPort, but listens on a Unix domain socket, rather than a TCP
    socket. (Unix and Unix-like systems only.)
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
<strong>ControlSocketsGroupWritable</strong> <strong>0</strong>|<strong>1</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    If this option is set to 0, don&#8217;t allow the filesystem group to read and
    write unix sockets (e.g. ControlSocket). If the option is set to 1, make
    the control socket readable and writable by the default GID. (Default: 0)
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
<strong>HashedControlPassword</strong> <em>hashed_password</em>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Allow connections on the control port if they present
    the password whose one-way hash is <em>hashed_password</em>. You
    can compute the hash of a password by running "tor --hash-password
    <em>password</em>". You can provide several acceptable passwords by using more
    than one HashedControlPassword line.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
<strong>CookieAuthentication</strong> <strong>0</strong>|<strong>1</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    If this option is set to 1, allow connections on the control port
    when the connecting process knows the contents of a file named
    "control_auth_cookie", which Tor will create in its data directory. This
    authentication method should only be used on systems with good filesystem
    security. (Default: 0)
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
<strong>CookieAuthFile</strong> <em>Path</em>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    If set, this option overrides the default location and file name
    for Tor&#8217;s cookie file. (See CookieAuthentication above.)
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
<strong>CookieAuthFileGroupReadable</strong> <strong>0</strong>|<strong>1</strong>|<em>Groupname</em>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    If this option is set to 0, don&#8217;t allow the filesystem group to read the
    cookie file. If the option is set to 1, make the cookie file readable by
    the default GID. [Making the file readable by other groups is not yet
    implemented; let us know if you need this for some reason.] (Default: 0).
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
<strong>ControlPortWriteToFile</strong> <em>Path</em>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    If set, Tor writes the address and port of any control port it opens to
    this address.  Usable by controllers to learn the actual control port
    when ControlPort is set to "auto".
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
<strong>ControlPortFileGroupReadable</strong> <strong>0</strong>|<strong>1</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    If this option is set to 0, don&#8217;t allow the filesystem group to read the
    control port file. If the option is set to 1, make the control port
    file readable by the default GID. (Default: 0).
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
<strong>DataDirectory</strong> <em>DIR</em>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Store working data in DIR (Default: /var/lib/tor)
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
<strong>DirServer</strong> [<em>nickname</em>] [<strong>flags</strong>] <em>address</em>:<em>port</em> <em>fingerprint</em>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Use a nonstandard authoritative directory server at the provided address
    and port, with the specified key fingerprint. This option can be repeated
    many times, for multiple authoritative directory servers. Flags are
    separated by spaces, and determine what kind of an authority this directory
    is. By default, every authority is authoritative for current ("v2")-style
    directories, unless the "no-v2" flag is given. If the "v1" flags is
    provided, Tor will use this server as an authority for old-style (v1)
    directories as well. (Only directory mirrors care about this.) Tor will
    use this server as an authority for hidden service information if the "hs"
    flag is set, or if the "v1" flag is set and the "no-hs" flag is <strong>not</strong> set.
    Tor will use this authority as a bridge authoritative directory if the
    "bridge" flag is set. If a flag "orport=<strong>port</strong>" is given, Tor will use the
    given port when opening encrypted tunnels to the dirserver. Lastly, if a
    flag "v3ident=<strong>fp</strong>" is given, the dirserver is a v3 directory authority
    whose v3 long-term signing key has the fingerprint <strong>fp</strong>.<br />
<br />
    If no <strong>dirserver</strong> line is given, Tor will use the default directory
    servers. NOTE: this option is intended for setting up a private Tor
    network with its own directory authorities. If you use it, you will be
    distinguishable from other users, because you won&#8217;t believe the same
    authorities they do.

    This option controls whether circuits built by Tor will include relays with
    the AllowSingleHopExits flag set to true. If ExcludeSingleHopRelays is set
    to 0, these relays will be included. Note that these relays might be at
    higher risk of being seized or observed, so they are not normally

    When set along with UseBridges, instructs Tor to use the relay at
    "IP:ORPort" as a "bridge" relaying into the Tor network. If "fingerprint"
    is provided (using the same format as for DirServer), we will verify that
    the relay running at that location has the right fingerprint. We also use

<br />
    By default, this option is treated as a preference that Tor is allowed
    to override in order to keep working.
    For example, if you try to connect to a hidden service,
    but you have excluded all of the hidden service&#8217;s introduction points,
    Tor will connect to one of them anyway.  If you do not want this
    behavior, set the StrictNodes option (documented below). <br />
<br />
    Note also that if you are a relay, this (and the other node selection
    options below) only affects your own circuits that Tor builds for you.

    Note that if you list too few nodes here, or if you exclude too many exit

    be able to browse the web.<br />
<br />
    Note also that not every circuit is used to deliver traffic outside of
    the Tor network.  It is normal to see non-exit circuits (such as those
    used to connect to hidden services, those that do directory fetches,
    those used for relay reachability self-tests, and so on) that end
    at a non-exit node.  To
    keep a node from being used entirely, see ExcludeNodes and StrictNodes.<br />

    option overrides this option; if you have configured bridges and
    UseBridges is 1, the Bridges are used as your entry nodes.<br />

    If StrictNodes is set to 1, Tor will treat the ExcludeNodes option as a

    will break functionality for you.  If StrictNodes is set to 0, Tor will
    still try to avoid nodes in the ExcludeNodes list, but it will err on the
    side of avoiding unexpected errors.  Specifically, StrictNodes 0 tells
    Tor that it is okay to use an excluded node when it is <strong>necessary</strong> to
    perform relay reachability self-tests, connect to
    a hidden service, provide a hidden service to a client, fulfill a .exit

    Like <strong>ReachableAddresses</strong>, a list of addresses and ports. Tor will obey
    these restrictions when connecting to Onion Routers, using TLS/SSL. If not
    set explicitly then the value of <strong>ReachableAddresses</strong> is used. If
    <strong>HTTPSProxy</strong> is set then these connections will go through that proxy.<br />
<br />
    The separation between <strong>ReachableORAddresses</strong> and
    <strong>ReachableDirAddresses</strong> is only interesting when you are connecting
    through proxies (see <strong>HTTPProxy</strong> and <strong>HTTPSProxy</strong>). Most proxies limit
    TLS connections (which Tor uses to connect to Onion Routers) to port 443,
    and some limit HTTP GET requests (which Tor uses for fetching directory
    information) to port 80.

<strong>LongLivedPorts</strong> <em>PORTS</em>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    A list of ports for services that tend to have long-running connections
    (e.g. chat and interactive shells). Circuits for streams that use these
    ports will contain only high-uptime nodes, to reduce the chance that a node
    will go down before the stream is finished. (Default: 21, 22, 706, 1863,
    5050, 5190, 5222, 5223, 6667, 6697, 8300)

<dt class="hdlist1">
<strong>MapAddress</strong> <em>address</em> <em>newaddress</em>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    When a request for address arrives to Tor, it will rewrite it to newaddress
    before processing it. For example, if you always want connections to
    www.indymedia.org to exit via <em>torserver</em> (where <em>torserver</em> is the
    nickname of the server), use "MapAddress www.indymedia.org
    www.indymedia.org.torserver.exit".

<strong>NodeFamily</strong> <em>node</em>,<em>node</em>,<em>&#8230;</em>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    The Tor servers, defined by their identity fingerprints or nicknames,
    constitute a "family" of similar or co-administered servers, so never use
    any two of them in the same circuit. Defining a NodeFamily is only needed
    when a server doesn&#8217;t list the family itself (with MyFamily). This option
    can be used multiple times.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
<strong>EnforceDistinctSubnets</strong> <strong>0</strong>|<strong>1</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    If 1, Tor will not put two servers whose IP addresses are "too close" on

    192.168.0.1:9100). This directive can be specified multiple times to bind
    to multiple addresses/ports.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
<strong>SocksPolicy</strong> <em>policy</em>,<em>policy</em>,<em>&#8230;</em>
</dt>

    policies below.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
<strong>SocksTimeout</strong> <em>NUM</em>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Let a socks connection wait NUM seconds handshaking, and NUM seconds

</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
<strong>TrackHostExits</strong> <em>host</em>,<em>.domain</em>,<em>&#8230;</em>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    For each value in the comma separated list, Tor will track recent
    connections to hosts that match this value and attempt to reuse the same
    exit node for each. If the value is prepended with a '.', it is treated as
    matching an entire domain. If one of the values is just a '.', it means
    match everything. This option is useful if you frequently connect to sites
    that will expire all your authentication cookies (i.e. log you out) if
    your IP address changes. Note that this option does have the disadvantage
    of making it more clear that a given history is associated with a single
    user. However, most people who would wish to observe this will observe it
    through cookies or other protocol-specific means anyhow.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
<strong>TrackHostExitsExpire</strong> <em>NUM</em>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Since exit servers go up and down, it is desirable to expire the
    association between host and exit server after NUM seconds. The default is
    1800 seconds (30 minutes).
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
<strong>UpdateBridgesFromAuthority</strong> <strong>0</strong>|<strong>1</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    When set (along with UseBridges), Tor will try to fetch bridge descriptors
    from the configured bridge authorities when feasible. It will fall back to
    a direct request if the authority responds with a 404. (Default: 0)
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
<strong>UseBridges</strong> <strong>0</strong>|<strong>1</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    When set, Tor will fetch descriptors for each bridge listed in the "Bridge"
    config lines, and use these relays as both entry guards and directory
    guards. (Default: 0)
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
<strong>UseEntryGuards</strong> <strong>0</strong>|<strong>1</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    If this option is set to 1, we pick a few long-term entry servers, and try
    to stick with them. This is desirable because constantly changing servers
    increases the odds that an adversary who owns some servers will observe a
    fraction of your paths. (Defaults to 1.)
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
<strong>NumEntryGuards</strong> <em>NUM</em>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    If UseEntryGuards is set to 1, we will try to pick a total of NUM routers
    as long-term entries for our circuits. (Defaults to 3.)
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
<strong>SafeSocks</strong> <strong>0</strong>|<strong>1</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    When this option is enabled, Tor will reject application connections that
    use unsafe variants of the socks protocol&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;ones that only provide an IP
    address, meaning the application is doing a DNS resolve first.
    Specifically, these are socks4 and socks5 when not doing remote DNS.
    (Defaults to 0.)
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
<strong>TestSocks</strong> <strong>0</strong>|<strong>1</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    When this option is enabled, Tor will make a notice-level log entry for
    each connection to the Socks port indicating whether the request used a
    safe socks protocol or an unsafe one (see above entry on SafeSocks). This
    helps to determine whether an application using Tor is possibly leaking
    DNS requests. (Default: 0)
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
<strong>WarnUnsafeSocks</strong> <strong>0</strong>|<strong>1</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    When this option is enabled, Tor will warn whenever a request is
    received that only contains an IP address instead of a hostname. Allowing
    applications to do DNS resolves themselves is usually a bad idea and
    can leak your location to attackers. (Default: 1)
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
<strong>VirtualAddrNetwork</strong> <em>Address</em>/<em>bits</em>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    When Tor needs to assign a virtual (unused) address because of a MAPADDRESS
    command from the controller or the AutomapHostsOnResolve feature, Tor
    picks an unassigned address from this range. (Default:
    127.192.0.0/10)<br />
<br />
    When providing proxy server service to a network of computers using a tool
    like dns-proxy-tor, change this address to "10.192.0.0/10" or
    "172.16.0.0/12". The default <strong>VirtualAddrNetwork</strong> address range on a
    properly configured machine will route to the loopback interface. For
    local use, no change to the default VirtualAddrNetwork setting is needed.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
<strong>AllowNonRFC953Hostnames</strong> <strong>0</strong>|<strong>1</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    When this option is disabled, Tor blocks hostnames containing illegal
    characters (like @ and :) rather than sending them to an exit node to be
    resolved. This helps trap accidental attempts to resolve URLs and so on.
    (Default: 0)
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
<strong>AllowDotExit</strong> <strong>0</strong>|<strong>1</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    If enabled, we convert "www.google.com.foo.exit" addresses on the
    SocksPort/TransPort/NATDPort into "www.google.com" addresses that exit from
    the node "foo". Disabled by default since attacking websites and exit
    relays can use it to manipulate your path selection. (Default: 0)
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
<strong>FastFirstHopPK</strong> <strong>0</strong>|<strong>1</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    When this option is disabled, Tor uses the public key step for the first
    hop of creating circuits. Skipping it is generally safe since we have
    already used TLS to authenticate the relay and to establish forward-secure
    keys. Turning this option off makes circuit building slower.<br />
<br />
    Note that Tor will always use the public key step for the first hop if it&#8217;s
    operating as a relay, and it will never use the public key step if it
    doesn&#8217;t yet know the onion key of the first hop. (Default: 1)

<strong>TransPort</strong> <em>PORT</em>|<strong>auto</strong>

    If non-zero, enables transparent proxy support on <em>PORT</em> (by convention,
    9040). Requires OS support for transparent proxies, such as BSDs' pf or
    Linux&#8217;s IPTables. If you&#8217;re planning to use Tor as a transparent proxy for
    a network, you&#8217;ll want to examine and change VirtualAddrNetwork from the
    default setting. You&#8217;ll also want to set the TransListenAddress option for
    the network you&#8217;d like to proxy.  Set it to "auto" to have Tor pick a

<strong>TransListenAddress</strong> <em>IP</em>[:<em>PORT</em>]
</dt>

    When this option is enabled, and we get a request to resolve an address
    that ends with one of the suffixes in <strong>AutomapHostsSuffixes</strong>, we map an
    unused virtual address to that address, and return the new virtual address.
    This is handy for making ".onion" addresses work with applications that
    resolve an address and then connect to it. (Default: 0).

<p>
    If true, Tor does not believe any anonymously retrieved DNS answer that
    tells it that an address resolves to an internal address (like 127.0.0.1 or
    192.168.0.1). This option prevents certain browser-based attacks; don&#8217;t
    turn it off unless you know what you&#8217;re doing. (Default: 1).
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
<strong>ClientRejectInternalAddresses</strong> <strong>0</strong>|<strong>1</strong>
</dt>

<p>
    If true, Tor does not try to fulfill requests to connect to an internal
    address (like 127.0.0.1 or 192.168.0.1) <em>unless a exit node is
    specifically requested</em> (for example, via a .exit hostname, or a

</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
<strong>DownloadExtraInfo</strong> <strong>0</strong>|<strong>1</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    If true, Tor downloads and caches "extra-info" documents. These documents
    contain information about servers other than the information in their
    regular router descriptors. Tor does not use this information for anything
    itself; to save bandwidth, leave this option turned off. (Default: 0).

<dt class="hdlist1">
<strong>FallbackNetworkstatusFile</strong> <em>FILENAME</em>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    If Tor doesn&#8217;t have a cached networkstatus file, it starts out using this
    one instead. Even if this file is out of date, Tor can still use it to
    learn about directory mirrors, so it doesn&#8217;t need to put load on the
    authorities. (Default: None).

</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
<strong>WarnPlaintextPorts</strong> <em>port</em>,<em>port</em>,<em>&#8230;</em>

<p>
    Tells Tor to issue a warnings whenever the user tries to make an anonymous

<dt class="hdlist1">
<strong>RejectPlaintextPorts</strong> <em>port</em>,<em>port</em>,<em>&#8230;</em>

<dd>
<p>
    The IP address or fully qualified domain name of this server (e.g.
    moria.mit.edu). You can leave this unset, and Tor will guess your IP
    address.  This IP address is the one used to tell clients and other
    servers where to find your Tor server; it doesn&#8217;t affect the IP that your
    Tor client binds to.  To bind to a different address, use the
    *ListenAddress and OutboundBindAddress options.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
<strong>AllowSingleHopExits</strong> <strong>0</strong>|<strong>1</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    This option controls whether clients can use this server as a single hop
    proxy. If set to 1, clients can use this server as an exit even if it is
    the only hop in the circuit.  Note that most clients will refuse to use
    servers that set this option, since most clients have
    ExcludeSingleHopRelays set.  (Default: 0)
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
<strong>AssumeReachable</strong> <strong>0</strong>|<strong>1</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    This option is used when bootstrapping a new Tor network. If set to 1,
    don&#8217;t do self-reachability testing; just upload your server descriptor
    immediately. If <strong>AuthoritativeDirectory</strong> is also set, this option
    instructs the dirserver to bypass remote reachability testing too and list
    all connected servers as running.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
<strong>BridgeRelay</strong> <strong>0</strong>|<strong>1</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Sets the relay to act as a "bridge" with respect to relaying connections
    from bridge users to the Tor network. It mainly causes Tor to publish a
    server descriptor to the bridge database, rather than publishing a relay
    descriptor to the public directory authorities.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
<strong>ContactInfo</strong> <em>email_address</em>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Administrative contact information for server. This line might get picked

<dt class="hdlist1">
<strong>ExitPolicy</strong> <em>policy</em>,<em>policy</em>,<em>&#8230;</em>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Set an exit policy for this server. Each policy is of the form
    "<strong>accept</strong>|<strong>reject</strong> <em>ADDR</em>[/<em>MASK</em>][:<em>PORT</em>]". If /<em>MASK</em> is
    omitted then this policy just applies to the host given. Instead of giving
    a host or network you can also use "*" to denote the universe (0.0.0.0/0).
    <em>PORT</em> can be a single port number, an interval of ports
    "<em>FROM_PORT</em>-<em>TO_PORT</em>", or "*". If <em>PORT</em> is omitted, that means
    "*".<br />
<br />
    For example, "accept 18.7.22.69:*,reject 18.0.0.0/8:*,accept *:*" would
    reject any traffic destined for MIT except for web.mit.edu, and accept
    anything else.<br />
<br />
    To specify all internal and link-local networks (including 0.0.0.0/8,
    169.254.0.0/16,    127.0.0.0/8,    192.168.0.0/16, 10.0.0.0/8, and
    172.16.0.0/12), you can use the "private" alias instead of an address.
    These addresses are rejected by default (at the beginning of your exit
    policy), along with your public IP address, unless you set the
    ExitPolicyRejectPrivate config option to 0. For example, once you&#8217;ve done
    that, you could allow HTTP to 127.0.0.1 and block all other connections to
    internal networks with "accept 127.0.0.1:80,reject private:*", though that
    may also allow connections to your own computer that are addressed to its
    public (external) IP address. See RFC 1918 and RFC 3330 for more details
    about internal and reserved IP address space.<br />
<br />
    This directive can be specified multiple times so you don&#8217;t have to put it
    all on one line.<br />
<br />
    Policies are considered first to last, and the first match wins. If you
    want to _replace_ the default exit policy, end your exit policy with
    either a reject *:* or an accept *:*. Otherwise, you&#8217;re _augmenting_
    (prepending to) the default exit policy. The default exit policy is:<br />

<p>
    This option specifies which descriptors Tor will publish when acting as
    a relay. You can
    choose multiple arguments, separated by commas.
<br />
    If this option is set to 0, Tor will not publish its
    descriptors to any directories. (This is useful if you&#8217;re testing
    out your server, or if you&#8217;re using a Tor controller that handles directory
    publishing for you.) Otherwise, Tor will publish its descriptors of all
    type(s) specified. The default is "1",
    which means "if running as a server, publish the
    appropriate descriptors to the authorities".

<dd>
<p>
    When we get a SIGINT and we&#8217;re a server, we begin shutting down:
    we close listeners and start refusing new circuits. After <strong>NUM</strong>

<strong>AccountingMax</strong> <em>N</em> <strong>bytes</strong>|<strong>KB</strong>|<strong>MB</strong>|<strong>GB</strong>|<strong>TB</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Never send more than the specified number of bytes in a given accounting
    period, or receive more than that number in the period. For example, with
    AccountingMax set to 1 GB, a server could send 900 MB and receive 800 MB
    and continue running. It will only hibernate once one of the two reaches 1
    GB. When the number of bytes gets low, Tor will stop accepting new
    connections and circuits.  When the number of bytes
    is exhausted, Tor will hibernate until some
    time in the next accounting period. To prevent all servers from waking at
    the same time, Tor will also wait until a random point in each period
    before waking up. If you have bandwidth cost issues, enabling hibernation
    is preferable to setting a low bandwidth, since it provides users with a
    collection of fast servers that are up some of the time, which is more
    useful than a set of slow servers that are always "available".

    of the <em>dayth</em> day of one week to the same day and time of the next week,
    with Monday as day 1 and Sunday as day 7. If <strong>day</strong> is given, each

    Prevent nodes that don&#8217;t appear in the consensus from exiting using this
    relay.  If the option is 1, we always block exit attempts from such
    nodes; if it&#8217;s 0, we never do, and if the option is "auto", then we do

<p>
    Overrides the default DNS configuration with the configuration in
    <em>filename</em>. The file format is the same as the standard Unix
    "<strong>resolv.conf</strong>" file (7). This option, like all other ServerDNS options,
    only affects name lookups that your server does on behalf of clients.
    (Defaults to use the system DNS configuration.)
</p>
</dd>

<p>
    If this option is false, Tor exits immediately if there are problems
    parsing the system DNS configuration or connecting to nameservers.
    Otherwise, Tor continues to periodically retry the system nameservers until
    it eventually succeeds. (Defaults to "1".)

</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
<strong>ServerDNSSearchDomains</strong> <strong>0</strong>|<strong>1</strong>
</dt>

<p>
    If set to 1, then we will search for addresses in the local search domain.
    For example, if this system is configured to believe it is in
    "example.com", and a client tries to connect to "www", the client will be
    connected to "www.example.com". This option only affects name lookups that

<p>
    When this option is set to 1, we will test periodically to determine
    whether our local nameservers have been configured to hijack failing DNS
    requests (usually to an advertising site). If they are, we will attempt to
    correct this. This option only affects name lookups that your server does

</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    When this option is disabled, Tor does not try to resolve hostnames
    containing illegal characters (like @ and :) rather than sending them to an
    exit node to be resolved. This helps trap accidental attempts to resolve
    URLs and so on. This option only affects name lookups that your server does
    on behalf of clients. (Default: 0)

<dd>
<p>
    When this option is enabled and BridgeRelay is also enabled, and we have
    GeoIP data, Tor keeps a keep a per-country count of how many client
    addresses have contacted it so that it can help the bridge authority guess
    which countries have blocked access to it. (Default: 1)
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
<strong>ServerDNSRandomizeCase</strong> <strong>0</strong>|<strong>1</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    When this option is set, Tor sets the case of each character randomly in
    outgoing DNS requests, and makes sure that the case matches in DNS replies.
    This so-called "0x20 hack" helps resist some types of DNS poisoning attack.
    For more information, see "Increased DNS Forgery Resistance through
    0x20-Bit Encoding". This option only affects name lookups that your server
    does on behalf of clients. (Default: 1)

    When this option is set to 1, Tor operates as an authoritative directory
    server. Instead of caching the directory, it generates its own list of
    good servers, signs it, and sends that to the clients. Unless the clients
    already have you listed as a trusted directory, you probably do not want
    to set this option. Please coordinate with the other admins at

    When this option is set to 1, then the server advertises that it has
    opinions about nickname-to-fingerprint bindings. It will include these
    opinions in its published network-status pages, by listing servers with
    the flag "Named" if a correct binding between that nickname and fingerprint
    has been registered with the dirserver. Naming dirservers will refuse to

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>The following options are used to configure a hidden service.</p></div>
<div class="dlist"><dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">
<strong>HiddenServiceDir</strong> <em>DIRECTORY</em>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Store data files for a hidden service in DIRECTORY. Every hidden service
    must have a separate directory. You may use this option  multiple times to
    specify multiple services. DIRECTORY must be an existing directory.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
<strong>HiddenServicePort</strong> <em>VIRTPORT</em> [<em>TARGET</em>]
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Configure a virtual port VIRTPORT for a hidden service. You may use this
    option multiple times; each time applies to the service using the most
    recent hiddenservicedir. By default, this option maps the virtual port to
    the same port on 127.0.0.1. You may override the target port, address, or
    both by specifying a target of addr, port, or addr:port. You may also have
    multiple lines with  the same VIRTPORT: when a user connects to that
    VIRTPORT, one of the TARGETs from those lines will be chosen at random.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
<strong>PublishHidServDescriptors</strong> <strong>0</strong>|<strong>1</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    If set to 0, Tor will run any hidden services you configure, but it won&#8217;t
    advertise them to the rendezvous directory. This option is only useful if
    you&#8217;re using a Tor controller that handles hidserv publishing for you.
    (Default: 1)
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
<strong>HiddenServiceVersion</strong> <em>version</em>,<em>version</em>,<em>&#8230;</em>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    A list of rendezvous service descriptor versions to publish for the hidden
    service. Currently, only version 2 is supported. (Default: 2)
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
<strong>HiddenServiceAuthorizeClient</strong> <em>auth-type</em> <em>client-name</em>,<em>client-name</em>,<em>&#8230;</em>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    If configured, the hidden service is accessible for authorized clients
    only. The auth-type can either be 'basic' for a general-purpose
    authorization protocol or 'stealth' for a less scalable protocol that also
    hides service activity from unauthorized clients. Only clients that are
    listed here are authorized to access the hidden service. Valid client names
    are 1 to 19 characters  long and only use characters in A-Za-z0-9+-_ (no
    spaces). If this option is set, the hidden service is not accessible for
    clients without authorization any more. Generated authorization data can be
    found in the hostname file. Clients need to put this authorization data in
    their configuration file using <strong>HidServAuth</strong>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
<strong>RendPostPeriod</strong> <em>N</em> <strong>seconds</strong>|<strong>minutes</strong>|<strong>hours</strong>|<strong>days</strong>|<strong>weeks</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Every time the specified period elapses, Tor uploads any rendezvous
    service descriptors to the directory servers. This information  is also
    uploaded whenever it changes. (Default: 1 hour)

<h2 id="_signals">SIGNALS</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>Tor catches the following signals:</p></div>
<div class="dlist"><dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">
<strong>SIGTERM</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Tor will catch this, clean up and sync to disk if necessary, and exit.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
<strong>SIGINT</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Tor clients behave as with SIGTERM; but Tor servers will do a controlled
    slow shutdown, closing listeners and waiting 30 seconds before exiting.
    (The delay can be configured with the ShutdownWaitLength config option.)
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
<strong>SIGHUP</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    The signal instructs Tor to reload its configuration (including closing and
    reopening logs), and kill and restart its helper processes if applicable.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
<strong>SIGUSR1</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Log statistics about current connections, past connections, and throughput.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
<strong>SIGUSR2</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Switch all logs to loglevel debug. You can go back to the old loglevels by
    sending a SIGHUP.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
<strong>SIGCHLD</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Tor receives this signal when one of its helper processes has exited, so it
    can clean up.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
<strong>SIGPIPE</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Tor catches this signal and ignores it.
</p>

<dd>
<p>
    These files hold downloaded router statuses. Some routers may appear more
    than once; if so, the most recently published descriptor is used. Lines
    beginning with @-signs are annotations that contain more information about
    a given router. The ".new" file is an append-only journal; when it gets
    too large, all entries are merged into a new cached-descriptors file.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
<em>DataDirectory</em><strong>/cached-routers</strong> and <strong>cached-routers.new</strong>

<dt class="hdlist1">
<em>DataDirectory</em><strong>/approved-routers</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Only for naming authoritative directory servers (see
    <strong>NamingAuthoritativeDirectory</strong>). This file lists nickname to identity
    bindings. Each line lists a nickname and a fingerprint separated by
    whitespace. See your <strong>fingerprint</strong> file in the <em>DataDirectory</em> for an
    example line. If the nickname is <strong>!reject</strong> then descriptors from the
    given identity (fingerprint) are rejected by this server. If it is
    <strong>!invalid</strong> then descriptors are accepted but marked in the directory as
    not valid, that is, not recommended.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
<em>DataDirectory</em><strong>/router-stability</strong>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Only used by authoritative directory servers. Tracks measurements for
